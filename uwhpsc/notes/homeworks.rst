Homework 
====================

.. warning :: For the Coursera class, this homework will not be submitted or 
              graded.  It is recommended that you do these problems in order
              to master the material, and use the discussion forum for help
              if you need it.

              Students are responsible for finding adequate computational 
              facilities and/or figuring out how to install and use the required
              software.  See :ref:`software_installation` for some
              instructions and other computing options.  Again the
              discussion forum may also be a useful resource.

There will be 6 suggested homeworks and a final project
during the quarter with target dates for completion listed below:

 * :ref:`homework1`: Week 2
 * :ref:`homework2`: Week 3

The following will be available roughly 2 weeks before the suggested
completion date: 

 * Homework 3: Week 5 
 * Homework 4: Week 6
 * Homework 5: Week 8
 * Homework 6: Week 9
 * Final Project: Week 10

These are essentially the same assignments used in the UW course.
