Notes on the Coursera Edition
=============================================================

This Coursera course is based on a course offered by the Applied Mathematics
Department at the  University of Washington.
These notes are a modified version of the notes
used in the class.  Please see :ref:`about` for more about the class notes.

Most of the lectures you will view were recorded during a live presentation
of the course.  Some discussions have been edited out, along with specific
discussion of interest only to UW students taking the course for credit.

Please note the following about the Coursera Edition:

* There is no direct faculty support for this course.  Please do not email
  the instructor -- there are too many students to allow any personalized
  response.


* A teaching assistant will moderate the discussion forum, but for the most
  part students must rely on other students to help out with difficulties
  that may arise.

* The software used in this course is all open source (freely available).  
  It is the responsibility of the student to find 
  adequate computational resources to do the suggested homework
  problems or otherwise explore the material.   See
  :ref:`software_installation` for some tips on installing software
  and pointers to some other computing options.  The discussion
  forum may also be a useful resource.

* One option to avoid  installing several packages is to use the 
  :ref:`vm`.  An introduction to the VM is given in one of the Week 1
  lectures.

* Another option is to compute "in the cloud", see :ref:`aws`.
  An introduction will be given in one of the Week 2 lectures.

* Each set of lectures will have a quiz associated with it. These will be
  automatically graded to give you feedback on whether you are understanding
  the material.  However, there is no credit or certificate given for this
  course and the grading is only for your own information.

* The suggested homework assignments will not be submitted or graded, they
  are simply an opportunity to get some hands-on practice with the material.
  Sample solutions will be posted at some point after the suggested
  completion date.
